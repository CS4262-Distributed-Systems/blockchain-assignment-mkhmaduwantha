Learning Outcomes

1)Smart contracts contain the business logic that governs assets on the blockchain ledger. Applications run by members of the network can invoke smart contracts to create assets on the ledger, as well as change and transfer those assets. Applications also query smart contracts to read data on the ledger.

2)In Fabric, smart contracts are deployed on the network in packages referred to as chaincode. A Chaincode is installed on the peers of an organization and then deployed to a channel, where it can then be used to endorse transactions and interact with the blockchain ledger.
